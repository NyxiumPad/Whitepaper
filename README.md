### 7.2 Badge System
In the NyxiumPad ecosystem, **badges are premium point multipliers** that can be **purchased exclusively through the official webApp**. They are not NFTs, not earned through activities, and cannot be transferred. Their sole purpose is to **boost the number of points** a user holds, which will directly impact the amount of **NYX tokens** received during the **Token Generation Event (TGE)**.
| Badge        | Multiplier | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| ü•à **Silver**   | 1.25x      | Entry-level badge for moderate point boost |
| ü•á **Gold**     | 1.5x       | Mid-tier badge offering stronger boost |
| üíé **Diamond**  | 2x         | Highest-tier badge with maximum multiplier |
- Badges can only be **purchased via the NyxiumPad webApp**
- They may be available as part of **limited-time booster packs**
- Users can **only hold one badge at a time**
- The highest-tier badge always takes effect

> **Note:** Badges are non-transferable, non-tradable, and account-bound.

### üìà Why Buy a Badge?

Badges significantly increase your NYX allocation at TGE by multiplying your total points.

> **Example:**  
> If you‚Äôve earned 10,000 points:  
> ‚Ä¢ No badge = 10,000 points  
> ‚Ä¢ Silver = 12,500 points  
> ‚Ä¢ Gold = 15,000 points  
> ‚Ä¢ Diamond = 20,000 points

### üîê Important Notes

- üö´ Badges are **not NFTs**
- üîÑ You can upgrade your badge anytime via the webApp
- üß† Strategic users may buy higher-tier badges closer to TGE to maximize returns
